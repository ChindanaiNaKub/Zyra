## Why
The project plan highlights risks around engine strength, premature optimization, and stochastic nondeterminism impacting tests and reproducibility. We need explicit spec coverage to enforce mitigations across tooling and workflows.

## What Changes
- Add risk mitigation requirements to `project-infrastructure` covering deterministic runs, profiling-first performance work, and style weight tuning workflows.
- Provide concrete scenarios to validate mitigation behaviors in CI and local tooling.

## Impact
- Affected specs: `specs/project-infrastructure/spec.md`
- Affected code/docs: benchmarking/profiling utilities, CLI flags for seeds/config snapshots, style profile configuration and documentation.
