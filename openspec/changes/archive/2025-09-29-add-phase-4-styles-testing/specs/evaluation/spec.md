## MODIFIED Requirements

### Requirement: Style Profiles System
The system SHALL provide configurable style profiles with predefined weight sets that create distinct playing personalities and measurable behavioral differences.

#### Scenario: Predefined style profiles
- **WHEN** initializing the engine
- **THEN** the system supports three predefined styles: aggressive, defensive, experimental

#### Scenario: Style weight configuration
- **WHEN** a style profile is selected
- **THEN** the system applies corresponding weight sets to material and positional evaluation terms

#### Scenario: Config-driven style selection
- **WHEN** the engine receives style configuration
- **THEN** the system parses and validates the configuration, applying appropriate weights

#### Scenario: Runtime style switching
- **WHEN** the engine is running and receives a new style configuration
- **THEN** the system updates the evaluation weights without restarting

#### Scenario: Style behavioral differentiation
- **WHEN** different style profiles are applied to the same position
- **THEN** the system produces measurably different evaluation outputs and move preferences

#### Scenario: Style influence transparency
- **WHEN** applying style profiles to evaluation
- **THEN** the system logs which weights are applied and how they affect the final score with clear attribution

### Requirement: Explainable Evaluation Logging
The system SHALL provide detailed logging of evaluation terms to enable understanding of decision-making and style influence tracking.

#### Scenario: Term breakdown logging
- **WHEN** evaluating a position
- **THEN** the system logs the contribution of each evaluation term (material, positional, style-weighted)

#### Scenario: Style weight transparency
- **WHEN** applying style profiles to evaluation
- **THEN** the system logs which weights are applied and how they affect the final score

#### Scenario: Move justification
- **WHEN** the engine selects a move
- **THEN** the system provides explainable reasoning based on evaluation term contributions

#### Scenario: Style influence attribution
- **WHEN** logging evaluation decisions
- **THEN** the system clearly identifies which style weights influenced each evaluation term

### Requirement: Evaluation Integration with Search
The system SHALL integrate evaluation signals with the search algorithm for style-aware move ordering and decision-making with measurable behavioral impact.

#### Scenario: Style-aware move ordering
- **WHEN** the search algorithm orders candidate moves
- **THEN** evaluation signals influence the ordering based on configured style preferences with measurable differences between styles

#### Scenario: Evaluation performance targets
- **WHEN** running evaluation during search
- **THEN** the system maintains evaluation speed targets (sufficient for ~10-20k nodes/sec search)

#### Scenario: Evaluation caching
- **WHEN** evaluating the same position multiple times
- **THEN** the system may cache evaluation results to improve performance (optional optimization)

#### Scenario: Style-aware evaluation blending
- **WHEN** blending evaluation signals during search
- **THEN** style weights influence the blending to create personality-consistent decisions

## ADDED Requirements

### Requirement: Style Behavioral Validation
The system SHALL provide comprehensive testing to validate that style profiles create observable behavioral differences and maintain consistency over time.

#### Scenario: Style differentiation validation
- **WHEN** testing different style profiles on the same positions
- **THEN** the system demonstrates measurable differences in evaluation outputs and move preferences with statistical significance

#### Scenario: Style consistency testing
- **WHEN** applying the same style profile to multiple similar positions
- **THEN** the system shows consistent behavioral patterns characteristic of that style

#### Scenario: Style regression detection
- **WHEN** running regression tests against style baselines
- **THEN** the system detects when style behaviors drift from expected patterns

#### Scenario: Golden baseline comparison
- **WHEN** validating style profile outputs against stored baselines
- **THEN** the system compares evaluation results against golden baseline files for regression detection

### Requirement: Style-Aware Playout Integration
The system SHALL integrate style profiles into MCTS playout policies to create personality-consistent simulation behavior.

#### Scenario: Style-weighted playout selection
- **WHEN** performing MCTS playout simulation
- **THEN** style weights influence move selection probability during random playouts

#### Scenario: Bounded randomness with style influence
- **WHEN** applying style influence to playout policies
- **THEN** the system maintains bounded randomness while expressing style preferences

#### Scenario: Deterministic style behavior with fixed seeds
- **WHEN** running style-aware playouts with fixed seeds
- **THEN** the system produces deterministic results for testing and validation

#### Scenario: Style playout diversity validation
- **WHEN** testing style-aware playouts
- **THEN** the system maintains sufficient diversity while expressing style characteristics
