## Context

The chess engine project requires a solid foundation before implementing game logic. The project conventions specify Python 3.11+, specific formatting standards, modular architecture, and trunk-based development workflow.

## Goals / Non-Goals

**Goals:**
- Establish consistent code quality standards across the project
- Create modular architecture supporting clear separation of concerns
- Enable automated formatting and type checking
- Provide clear documentation for contributors
- Set up reproducible development environment

**Non-Goals:**
- Complex build systems or deployment automation (keep simple)
- Advanced CI/CD pipelines beyond basic testing and formatting
- Integration with external services or databases

## Decisions

**Decision: Use pyproject.toml for all tool configuration**
- **Rationale**: Modern Python standard, consolidates all tool configs in one place
- **Alternatives considered**: setup.py, requirements.txt, separate config files
- **Trade-off**: Simpler maintenance vs. older tool compatibility

**Decision: Black with line length 100**
- **Rationale**: Matches project conventions, improves readability for chess logic
- **Alternatives considered**: Default 88, other formatters like autopep8
- **Trade-off**: Slightly longer lines vs. consistency with project specs

**Decision: Modular directory structure with separate concerns**
- **Rationale**: Clear separation enables independent development and testing
- **Alternatives considered**: Flat structure, fewer modules
- **Trade-off**: More directories vs. better organization and testability

## Risks / Trade-offs

- **Risk**: Over-engineering the foundation → **Mitigation**: Keep configuration minimal, add complexity only when needed
- **Risk**: Tool conflicts or version issues → **Mitigation**: Pin versions in pyproject.toml, document exact Python version
- **Risk**: Developer onboarding friction → **Mitigation**: Clear README with quick start, automated setup scripts

## Migration Plan

No migration needed - this is initial project setup.

## Open Questions

- Should we include a simple Makefile for common development tasks?
- Do we need a requirements-dev.txt for development dependencies?
