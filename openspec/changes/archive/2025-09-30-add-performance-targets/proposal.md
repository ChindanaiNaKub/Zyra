## Why
The current specifications contain scattered performance targets and constraints that need to be consolidated and made explicit across all relevant capabilities. Performance targets are mentioned in plan.md and evaluation spec but lack comprehensive coverage and clear requirements.

## What Changes
- **ADDED**: Comprehensive performance targets specification across search, evaluation, and engine-core capabilities
- **MODIFIED**: Existing evaluation performance requirements to be more explicit and measurable
- **ADDED**: Performance benchmarking and validation requirements
- **ADDED**: Performance regression testing requirements

## Impact
- Affected specs: search, evaluation, engine-core
- Affected code: search algorithms, evaluation functions, core engine components
- Enables: Clear performance expectations, benchmarking infrastructure, performance regression detection
