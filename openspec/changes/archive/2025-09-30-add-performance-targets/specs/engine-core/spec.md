## ADDED Requirements
### Requirement: Engine Core Performance Targets
The system SHALL meet specific performance targets for core engine operations including board representation, move generation, and rule validation.

#### Scenario: Move generation performance
- **WHEN** generating legal moves for a standard position
- **THEN** the system completes move generation in under 0.01ms for positions with typical move counts

#### Scenario: Board representation efficiency
- **WHEN** performing board operations (make/unmake moves, position evaluation)
- **THEN** the system maintains efficient 0x88 mailbox operations with minimal overhead

#### Scenario: Rule validation performance
- **WHEN** validating moves for legality (check detection, castling rights, en passant)
- **THEN** the system completes validation in under 0.005ms per move

#### Scenario: Core performance consistency
- **WHEN** running core operations across different position types
- **THEN** the system maintains consistent performance within 50% variance across position complexities

### Requirement: Core Performance Optimization Guidelines
The system SHALL implement performance optimizations for core engine components while maintaining code clarity and correctness.

#### Scenario: Efficient board operations
- **WHEN** performing frequent board operations
- **THEN** the system uses optimized algorithms for piece location, attack detection, and move validation

#### Scenario: Memory-efficient data structures
- **WHEN** managing board state and move history
- **THEN** the system uses memory-efficient data structures with minimal allocation overhead

#### Scenario: Performance profiling for core components
- **WHEN** performance profiling is enabled
- **THEN** the system provides detailed timing for board operations, move generation, and rule validation

### Requirement: Core Performance Benchmarking
The system SHALL provide performance benchmarking for core engine components to validate speed targets and detect regressions.

#### Scenario: Core performance benchmark execution
- **WHEN** running core performance benchmarks
- **THEN** the system measures and reports timing for board operations, move generation, and rule validation

#### Scenario: Core performance regression detection
- **WHEN** running core performance regression tests
- **THEN** the system detects when core performance degrades below acceptable thresholds

#### Scenario: Perft performance validation
- **WHEN** running perft tests for performance validation
- **THEN** the system completes perft calculations within reasonable time bounds while maintaining accuracy
