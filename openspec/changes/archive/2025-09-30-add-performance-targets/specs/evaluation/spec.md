## MODIFIED Requirements
### Requirement: Evaluation Integration with Search
The system SHALL integrate evaluation signals with the search algorithm for style-aware move ordering and decision-making with measurable behavioral impact while meeting performance targets.

#### Scenario: Style-aware move ordering
- **WHEN** the search algorithm orders candidate moves
- **THEN** evaluation signals influence the ordering based on configured style preferences with measurable differences between styles

#### Scenario: Evaluation performance targets
- **WHEN** running evaluation during search
- **THEN** the system maintains evaluation speed sufficient for 10,000-20,000 nodes/sec search performance with individual evaluations completing in under 0.1ms

#### Scenario: Evaluation caching
- **WHEN** evaluating the same position multiple times
- **THEN** the system may cache evaluation results to improve performance (optional optimization)

#### Scenario: Style-aware evaluation blending
- **WHEN** blending evaluation signals during search
- **THEN** style weights influence the blending to create personality-consistent decisions

## ADDED Requirements
### Requirement: Evaluation Performance Optimization
The system SHALL implement evaluation optimizations to meet performance targets while maintaining accuracy and style-aware behavior.

#### Scenario: Fast evaluation for common positions
- **WHEN** evaluating standard chess positions
- **THEN** the system completes evaluation in under 0.1ms per position

#### Scenario: Evaluation performance profiling
- **WHEN** performance profiling is enabled
- **THEN** the system provides timing breakdowns for material, positional, and style evaluation components

#### Scenario: Memory-efficient evaluation
- **WHEN** running evaluation during extended search
- **THEN** the system maintains memory usage within reasonable bounds without memory leaks

### Requirement: Evaluation Performance Benchmarking
The system SHALL provide evaluation performance benchmarking to validate speed targets and detect regressions.

#### Scenario: Evaluation speed benchmarking
- **WHEN** running evaluation benchmarks
- **THEN** the system measures and reports evaluation speed, memory usage, and accuracy metrics

#### Scenario: Evaluation performance regression testing
- **WHEN** running evaluation regression tests
- **THEN** the system detects when evaluation performance degrades below acceptable thresholds

#### Scenario: Style evaluation performance consistency
- **WHEN** testing evaluation performance across style profiles
- **THEN** all style profiles maintain similar evaluation speed with minimal variance
