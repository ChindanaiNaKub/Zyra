## Purpose
TBD - created by archiving change initialize-project-infrastructure. Update Purpose after archive.
## Requirements
### Requirement: Python Project Configuration
The project SHALL use modern Python tooling and configuration standards for code quality, formatting, and type checking.

#### Scenario: Developer runs formatting tools
- **WHEN** a developer runs `black` or `isort` on the codebase
- **THEN** code is formatted according to project conventions (black line length 100)

#### Scenario: Developer runs type checking
- **WHEN** a developer runs `mypy` on core modules
- **THEN** type errors are reported for improved code reliability

#### Scenario: Developer commits code
- **WHEN** a developer attempts to commit code
- **THEN** pre-commit hooks automatically run formatting and linting checks

### Requirement: Modular Repository Structure
The project SHALL organize code into logical modules with clear separation of concerns.

#### Scenario: Developer imports a module
- **WHEN** a developer imports from `core`, `search`, `eval`, `interfaces`, or `cli`
- **THEN** the module loads successfully and provides the expected functionality

#### Scenario: Developer runs tests
- **WHEN** a developer runs tests from the `tests/` directory
- **THEN** all test modules execute without import errors

### Requirement: Development Documentation
The project SHALL provide clear documentation for contributors and users.

#### Scenario: New contributor reads project setup
- **WHEN** a new contributor reads the README.md
- **THEN** they understand the project purpose and can set up the development environment

#### Scenario: Developer configures engine style
- **WHEN** a developer wants to modify engine personality
- **THEN** they can reference STYLE_PROFILES.md for configuration options

### Requirement: Git Workflow Standards
The project SHALL use trunk-based development with automated quality checks.

#### Scenario: Developer creates feature branch
- **WHEN** a developer creates a feature branch for new functionality
- **THEN** they follow the documented branching strategy and commit conventions

#### Scenario: CI runs on pull request
- **WHEN** a pull request is created or updated
- **THEN** automated checks run for formatting, linting, and basic tests
